# Solving a Quadratic Assignment Problem using genetic algorithms in Python3

The objective of this practice is to solve a typical optimization problem using evolutionary computation techniques. Several variants of evolutionary algorithms should be implemented to solve the problem of quadratic assignment, including at least the variants described in this practice guide.
